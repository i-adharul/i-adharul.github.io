							<h1>Part 1 - Olist business condition & customer segmentation</h1>

							<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">About the data and the project</h2>
							<p>This project uses data that has been shared by Olist, Dabague, and Francisco Magioli on Kaggle,
								 you can see the data <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
							<p>It is explained that this data is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. 
								There are also a few other paragraphs explaining what this olist actually is, but it still seems quite confusing. 
								So I finally searched the web, <a href="https://olist.com/pt-br/solucoes-para-comercio/vender-em-marketplaces/" target="_blank">here</a>, to find out the context and business model of Olist.</p>	
							<p>So in short, Olist is a SaaS company that helps SMEs to sell in many e-commerce sites in Brazil and America with only 
								one registration. With Olist, SMEs do not need to create multiple accounts in many e-commerce sites. However, 
								the account name used to sell in each of these e-commerce is Olist Store. So basically, these SMEs display their 
								merchandise on the Olist Store account while getting several other services such as consulting product displays and ads, 
								adjusting product prices, reporting dashboards, product delivery management, lower courier costs, stock management, etc.</p>
							<p>From an understanding of Olist and its business model, we can see that there are many interesting things that can be explored, 
								starting from the aspect of sellers, consumers, products sold, marketing, delivery of goods, etc.</p>								
							<p>If you look at the description of the data on Kaggle, there is no specific problem to solve with this data. Therefore, 
								in this project, I will first explore the dataset to understand first the condition of Olist's business and what has happened 
								in Olist at this time. Then dig deeper into the problem and recommend solutions that can improve Olist's business aspects.</p>

							<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">Olist business condition</h2>
							
							<p>This section only shows what has been and is happening at Olist until August 2018 so that we know where the problem lies 
								or what aspects of the business we should or can improve on.</p>

							<p >Based on their website, one of Olist's revenues comes from commissions on the sale of its users' products (seller). Therefore, 
								one of the important metrics to look at is revenue itself and number of orders. 
								As shown in the graph, revenue and number of orders have a similar trend, that is an increase of more than 9 times until 
								November 2017 but stagnant and tends to decrease until August 2018. On the other hand, 
								the trend of the average order review score of Olist during 2017 to 2018 actually decreased and then increased sharply 
								from March 2018 to August 2018.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/monthly_revenue_and_number_of_order.png" alt=""/></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/monthly_average_order_review_score.png" alt="" 
							style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>
								
							<p>Now lets move a little bit deeper. In terms of order cancellations due to product unavailability, it shows a downward trend 
								and in terms of average delivery time until the product reaches the customer, it also decreases. Both of these things show 
								good results for Olist, which may also be quite influential for the increase in the order review score which increased in mid-2018.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/monthly_delivery_time_and_product_unavailability.png" alt=""/></span>

							<p>Even though this is good for Olist, the average delivery time and review score, which are experiencing an increasing trend, 
								still have some notes that need further attention, because there are still orders that have arrived in more than 1 month, 
								and there are still customers who give a rating score below 3.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/avg_delivery_time_and_avg_score.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<p>Back to revenue, here is the distribution of revenue when viewed from several different aspects.</p>

							<p>First, in terms of payment type. The majority of payment types used by customers are credit cards. And there has been 
								a slight shift in the use of the payment method from 2017 and 2018. Namely, credit card and debit card users are increasing, 
								while boleto has decreased and vouchers are no longer available.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/revenue_per_payment_type.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<p>Second, from the Customer State side, 80% of revenue only comes from 7 states where 60% of revenue comes from the top 3 states, 
								namely Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerasi. This also applies to revenue per customer city, all of the top 10 cities 
								come from the top ten states.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cust_state_city.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<p>Third, from the seller's point of view. In contrast to customer cities, sellers who contribute to revenue, 65% come from one state,
								 namely Sao Paulo. Then followed by Minsa Gerais and Parana with a percentage of 8% each.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/seller_state_city.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>
									
							<p>Finally, in terms of product categories. Although the data looks fairly even for each category, if you look further, house wares
								 and furniture are the products that contribute the most revenue.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/product_category.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<p>Now move to the next metrics apart from revenue, that is the customer cohort. From the graph, it can be seen that only less than
								 1 percent of customers buy products more than once at Olist.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/customer_cohort.png" alt="" 
									style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">Customer Segmentation</h2>
							<p>After knowing the condition of Olist's business, now we talk about who our customers really are. And 
								before segmenting our customers based on several variables, it's a good idea to segment them based 
								on the value of our current customers. And one approach that can be used is RFM.</p>

							<p>RFM stands for recency, frequency, monetary value. In business analytics, we can use this concept 
								to divide customers into different segments, like high-value customers, medium value customers or 
								low-value customers, and similarly many others.</p>
								
							<p>For those who don't know what RFM stands for, here is the definition:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Recency: How recently has the customer made a transaction with us</li>
								<li>Frequency: How frequent is the customer in ordering/buying some product from us</li>
								<li>Monetary: How much does the customer spend on purchasing product from us</li>
							</ul>
								
							<p>After doing the clustering process. As a result, I found the segment division into 4 categories or clusters 
								as shown in the table below.</p>	
								
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/rfm_table.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<p>To differentiate between clusters, look at the vertical red box section with the column name 'median'. 
								And based on the median, we can find out the characteristics of each cluster. Following are the names and brief explanations 
								for each cluster:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Cluster 0 [New customer]: Customer segment that has made 1 transaction about 1 month ago with spending around 100 R$
								<li>Cluster 1 [Churning low spending customers]: Customer segment who have made 1 transaction about 6 months ago with spending around 50 R$</li>
								<li>Cluster 2 [Churning high spending customers]: Customer segment who have made 1 transaction about 6 months ago with spending around 160 R $. This cluster is the cluster with the second largest number of customers (about 35%) and the highest spending per customer. So this cluster is the highest revenue producer.</li>
								<li>Cluster 3 [Retained customers]: Customer segment who have made more than 1 transaction about 4 months ago with spending around 150 R$</li></li>
							</ul>
								
							<p>In addition, the following is an illustration of the distribution of each cluster.</p></p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3d_clustering.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2d_clustering.png" alt="" 
								style="width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></span>

							<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">What's Next?</h2>
							<p>Now we know the business conditions and Olist customer segmentation. 
								And from there, there are several things that need to be a concern, that is:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Revenue Olist decreased during 2018.</li>
								<li>There are still some users who give a rating below 3 or even 1.</li>
								<li>Even though the average delivery time is getting better, there are still some products that have arrived more than 1 month</li>
								<li>Customers who buy products on olist more than 1 time are only less than 1%</li>
							</ol>
							<p>After knowing these problems, then the data analysis process will be directed to find out what the cause of 
								the problem is and how to solve it. The solution can be focused on marketing, business and operations, or product development.</p>
